    "answer": "### Adapter Pattern\n\n- Allows incompatible interfaces to work together\n- Acts as a bridge between two interfaces\n- Wraps one interface to make it compatible with another\n\n**Use Cases:**\n- Integrating legacy code\n- Third-party libraries"

    "answer": "### Factory Pattern\n\n- Defines an interface for creating an object\n- Subclasses alter the type of object created\n- Useful when object creation involves complex logic or depends on conditions\n\n**Example (Java):**\n```java\npublic interface Product {}\npublic class ConcreteProductA implements Product {}\npublic class ConcreteProductB implements Product {}\npublic class Factory {\n  public Product createProduct(String type) {\n    if (type.equals(\"A\")) return new ConcreteProductA();\n    else return new ConcreteProductB();\n  }\n}\n```"

    "answer": "### Observer Pattern\n\n- Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects\n- When one object changes state, all dependents are notified\n- Widely used in event-driven systems\n\n**Use Cases:**\n- UI frameworks\n- Event listeners\n- Publish/subscribe systems"

    "answer": "**Design patterns** are general solutions to common problems in software design.\n\n- Provide templates or blueprints for solving issues in a specific context\n- Help create flexible, reusable, and scalable code\n\n**Categories:**\n- **Creational:** Object creation mechanisms (e.g., Singleton, Factory)\n- **Structural:** Composition of classes/objects (e.g., Adapter, Decorator)\n- **Behavioral:** Object interaction and responsibilities (e.g., Observer, Strategy)"
